Secured and Monitored Three Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com
Components:
Firewalls (3): Implemented to control incoming and outgoing network traffic, enhancing security by filtering malicious or unauthorized access.

SSL Certificate: Installed on the web server to enable HTTPS encryption, ensuring secure communication between clients and the server.

Monitoring Clients (3): Installed on each server to collect performance metrics, logs, and other data for analysis and troubleshooting.

Specifics:
1. Additional Elements:

Firewalls: Added for network security, restricting access to authorized traffic and protecting against unauthorized access or attacks.
SSL Certificate: Implemented to encrypt traffic between clients and the server, safeguarding sensitive information from interception.
Monitoring Clients: Deployed to monitor server performance, detect anomalies, and ensure smooth operation of the infrastructure.
2. Purpose of Firewalls:

Firewalls control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic, blocking unauthorized access and defending against various network-based attacks, such as DDoS, malware, and intrusion attempts.
3. Traffic Served over HTTPS:

HTTPS encrypts data transmitted between the client and server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of information, particularly sensitive data like login credentials, personal information, etc.
4. Purpose of Monitoring:

Monitoring provides insights into server performance, resource utilization, application health, and security events.
It helps in detecting and diagnosing issues promptly, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring high availability and reliability.
5. Data Collection in Monitoring Tool:

Monitoring clients collect various metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, network traffic, application logs, error logs, etc.
These metrics are sent to the monitoring tool (e.g., Sumo Logic) for analysis, visualization, and alerting.
6. Monitoring Web Server QPS:

To monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second), monitoring clients can track the number of HTTP requests received by the web server over a specific time period.
Analyzing this metric helps in understanding server load, identifying potential bottlenecks, and optimizing server performance.
Issues:
1. Terminating SSL at Load Balancer Level:

Terminating SSL at the load balancer exposes decrypted traffic within the internal network, potentially compromising data confidentiality.
It's advisable to maintain end-to-end encryption by terminating SSL at the web server level.
2. Single MySQL Server for Writes:

Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes introduces a single point of failure. If the server fails, write operations will be disrupted.
Implementing MySQL replication with a primary and replica node can improve fault tolerance and availability.
3. Uniform Server Components:

Using identical components across servers may lead to uniform vulnerabilities and dependencies. A single vulnerability could potentially affect all servers simultaneously.
Diversifying components or implementing redundancy can mitigate this risk and enhance overall resilience.
