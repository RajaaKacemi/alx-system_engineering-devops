Three Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com
Components:
Web Server (Nginx): Handles incoming HTTP requests, serves static content, and forwards dynamic requests to the application server.

Application Server: Executes the application logic and generates dynamic content for client requests.

Load Balancer (HAproxy): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and scalability.

Database (MySQL): Stores and manages the website's data.

Specifics:
1. Additional Elements:

Load Balancer (HAproxy): Added to distribute traffic among multiple servers, improving reliability and scalability.
Database (MySQL): Required to store and manage website data.
2. Load Balancer Configuration:

Configured with Round-Robin distribution algorithm. It evenly distributes incoming requests among the available servers.
3. Active-Active vs. Active-Passive:

Active-Active setup: Both servers are actively serving traffic simultaneously. If one server fails, the other can still handle incoming requests.
Active-Passive setup: One server serves traffic actively while the other remains idle (passive). If the active server fails, the passive one takes over.
4. Database Primary-Replica Cluster:

The primary node (master) handles write operations and synchronizes data changes to replica nodes (slaves).
Replica nodes serve read-only queries and can take over if the primary node fails.
5. Difference Between Primary and Replica Nodes:

Primary Node: Handles write operations, ensuring data consistency and integrity. It's critical for the application's functionality.
Replica Node: Serves read-only queries, improving read performance. It acts as a backup in case the primary node fails.
Issues:
1. Single Point of Failure (SPOF):

The entire infrastructure lacks redundancy. Failure of any component can lead to service disruption.
No redundancy in servers, load balancer, or database.
2. Security Issues:

No firewall protection exposes servers to potential attacks.
Lack of HTTPS encryption leaves data vulnerable to interception.
3. No Monitoring:

Absence of monitoring tools makes it challenging to detect and respond to performance issues or security breaches promptly.
