**** 1. OSI Model: ****

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a reference framework that explains how data is transmitted between computers. It consists of seven layers, each with specific functions:
Physical Layer: Handles the actual physical connection between devices, transmitting individual bits.
Data Link Layer: Ensures error-free data transfer between nodes using MAC addresses.
Network Layer: Manages routing and logical addressing (IP addresses).
Transport Layer: Ensures reliable end-to-end communication (TCP and UDP).
Session Layer: Establishes, maintains, and terminates communication sessions.
Presentation Layer: Translates data formats and provides encryption.
Application Layer: Supports user applications (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.) 1.

**** 2. LAN (Local Area Network): ****

A LAN connects devices within a limited area (e.g., a building, office, or home).
Typical Usage: Sharing files, printers, and internet access.
Geographical Size: Small (within a single location) 2.

**** 3. WAN (Wide Area Network): ****

A WAN connects LANs or other networks over larger distances.
Typical Usage: Interconnecting offices across cities or countries.
Geographical Size: Large (covers wide regions) 3.

**** 4. The Internet: ****

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and networks.
Function: Provides communication, data services, and access to websites.
IP Address: A unique numerical label assigned to devices for communication 4.

**** 5. IP Address: ****

An IP address identifies a device on a network.
Types:
IPv4: 32-bit address (e.g., 192.0.2.1).
IPv6: 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1) 5.

**** 6. Localhost: ****

Localhost refers to the current device itself (127.0.0.1).
Used for testing and development.

**** 7. Subnet: ****

A subnet is a portion of a larger network, logically separated.
Helps manage IP address allocation.

**** 8. Why IPv6? ****

IPv6 was created due to IPv4 address exhaustion.
Provides a larger address space and better scalability.

*** 9. TCP vs. UDP: ****

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Reliable, connection-oriented, ensures data integrity.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Unreliable, connectionless, faster for real-time applications.

**** 10. Ports: ****

A port is a communication endpoint in a device.
SSH: Port 22 (secure shell).
HTTP: Port 80 (web browsing).
HTTPS: Port 443 (secure web browsing).

**** 11. Device Connectivity Check: ****

The ping tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network.
