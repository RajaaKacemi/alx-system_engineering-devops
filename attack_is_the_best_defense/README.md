Background
Security is a critical aspect of computing, especially concerning network communication. Unencrypted traffic poses significant risks as it can be intercepted and exploited by malicious actors. Legacy systems, such as telnet, are particularly vulnerable to interception due to their lack of encryption.

#Tasks
#ARP Spoofing and Traffic Sniffing: Explore the concept of ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic to understand the vulnerabilities in network communication.
#Instructions
#Clone the repository containing the necessary scripts.
#Execute the user_authenticating_into_server script locally on your Ubuntu or Linux machine.
#Use tcpdump to sniff the network traffic generated during the authentication process.
#Analyze the captured traffic to identify any sensitive information, such as passwords.
#Note any findings and observations for further analysis.
#Note: The provided script may display "Authentication failed: Bad username / password" in the tcpdump trace due to the deletion of the user from the Sendgrid account. This is normal, and verification of the password via Sendgrid is not possible.

SSH Account Dictionary Attack
This project focuses on performing a dictionary attack on an SSH account using Docker and Hydra. The goal is to demonstrate the vulnerability of password-based authentication systems to brute force attacks.

Background
Password-based authentication systems are susceptible to dictionary attacks, where an attacker attempts to login using a list of commonly used passwords. This project aims to showcase the effectiveness of such attacks on an SSH account.

Tasks
Performing a Dictionary Attack: Utilize Docker to run a container with an SSH service and use Hydra to conduct a dictionary attack on the SSH account.
#Instructions
#Install Docker:

#Follow the official Docker installation guide for Ubuntu to install Docker on your machine.
#Run Docker Container:

#Pull and run the Docker image sylvainkalache/264-1 using the command:
#arduino
#Copy code
#docker run -p 2222:22 -d -ti sylvainkalache/264-1
#Obtain Password Dictionary:

#Find or create a password dictionary to use for the dictionary attack. Ensure that it contains a variety of commonly used passwords.
#Install Hydra:

#Install Hydra, a powerful tool for performing brute force attacks, on your local machine.
#Execute Dictionary Attack:

#Use Hydra to attempt to brute force the SSH account sylvain on the Docker container.
#css
#Copy code
#hydra -l sylvain -P /path/to/password/dictionary.txt ssh://127.0.0.1:2222
#Monitor Progress:

#Hydra will attempt various combinations of passwords from the dictionary. Monitor its progress to see if it successfully identifies the correct password.
#Retrieve Password:

#Once the password is found, record it for further analysis.
#Note: The password for the SSH account is 11 characters long.
